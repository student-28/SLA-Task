  <h3>Self-Introduction</h3>
  <p>Firstly, I want to thank you for allowing me this opportunity to introduce myself.
    My name is Nandhagopal. I am from Trichy. I did my graduation in a B.E from K.Ramakrishnan College of Engineering.
Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in various aspects of Logical building. In addition to this, I have done a short-term course in Programming languages where I have gained theortical skills like Java,MySQL,VCS</p>
<p>My strengths are that I'm a good learner, self-motivated and a hard-working person.
  My weakness is that I'm an overthinker. I overthink a lot about my career, future and goals.</p>
<p>My hobbies and interests are Playing Cricket and Video Games, listening to songs, and spending time with my family and friends.</p>
